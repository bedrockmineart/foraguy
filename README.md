Probs a bot

**You will have to install node into the folder I tell you to create bellow**

Hello Under! This is your bot that I made :).

Just click the clone or download button and download!

Once done put all the files into a folder 

Go to the file called 'config.json' and put your token in the bit where it says 'token'

then head to heroku.com

make a new app then go it should tell you some commands to do in yourm terminal

If you get stuck just tell me and I will commit it for you (if oyu add me to the app)
